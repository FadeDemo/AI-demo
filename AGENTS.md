# Repository Agent Instructions

## Scope and precedence

- This file applies to the entire repository.
- A nested `AGENTS.md` may add stricter rules for its own directory. If a nested rule conflicts with this file, follow the more specific nested rule.
- Follow the repository's general Markdown conventions in [`docs/markdown-style-guide.md`](docs/markdown-style-guide.md) in addition to the agent-specific safeguards below.

## Documentation changes

### Markdown emphasis boundaries

When bold text is followed by continuing prose, place one ASCII space after the closing `**`. This is required even when Prettier and markdownlint report no problem, because some Markdown renderers do not recognize a closing emphasis delimiter that touches the following letter or CJK character.

Do not place the bold segment `**标准输出（stdout）**` immediately before the prose `用于程序正常产生的结果。` without a space. Likewise, do not place the bold list-item title `**对照文本日志和 JSON 日志。**` immediately before `在仓库根目录执行。`

Write:

```markdown
**标准输出（stdout）** 用于程序正常产生的结果。

1. **对照文本日志和 JSON 日志。** 在仓库根目录执行。
```

Punctuation may directly follow bold text when normal typography requires it, for example `**important**：`. The mandatory space applies when the next character is a letter or number, including CJK characters.

### Markdown validation

For every Markdown change:

1. Format the changed Markdown files with the repository-local Prettier.
2. Scan the changed files for a bold closing delimiter followed immediately by a letter or number. The following command must produce no matches:

   ```shell
   rg -nP '`[^`\n]*`(*SKIP)(*F)|\*\*[^*\n]+\*\*(?![\p{L}\p{N}])(*SKIP)(*F)|\*\*[^*\n]+\*\*(?=[\p{L}\p{N}])' <changed-markdown-files>
   ```

3. Lint the changed Markdown files with the repository-local `markdownlint-cli2`.
4. Inspect newly added or edited emphasis manually when rendered output is part of the reported issue. Formatter and linter success alone is not sufficient verification for delimiter-boundary defects.

## Extending these instructions

- Add future repository-wide rules under a section named for the affected artifact or workflow, such as `Documentation changes`, `Python changes`, `Testing`, or `Version control`.
- Put module-specific rules in a nested `AGENTS.md` near that module instead of adding unrelated detail here.
- Keep each rule testable: state the required behavior, include a failing and passing example when syntax is subtle, and name the verification command when one exists.
- Do not duplicate long tool instructions in this file. Link to the repository's maintained guide and record only the agent-specific requirement or safeguard here.
